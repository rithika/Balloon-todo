## ✨ Features

- **Floating Tasks**: Every todo you add spawns as a beautiful pastel balloon that floats naturally in a dynamic sky.
- **Matter.js Physics**: Experience realistic movement! Balloons bob, collide, and sway with "swiggly" threads powered by a custom physics engine.
- **Atmospheric Vibes**: A full-screen gradient sky with procedurally generated clouds that drift lazily in the background.
- **Interactive Modals**: Click any balloon to focus on it. The physics pauses, the sky dims, and you can edit your task or mark it as complete.
- **The Ultimate "Done" Feeling**: When you finish a task, click **Complete** to watch your balloon pop in a satisfying burst of color-matched confetti!
- **Responsive Sky**: The physics boundaries automatically adjust to your window size, ensuring your balloons never drift out of reach.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Inflate a Task**: Type your todo in the floating control bar at the top and hit **Add**.
2. **Hover to Inspect**: Not sure which balloon is which? Hover over one to see a helpful tooltip.
3. **Grab & Focus**: Click a balloon to "grab" it and open the task menu.
