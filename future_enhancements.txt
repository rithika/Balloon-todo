✨ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS FOR BALLOON TODO ✨

--- AESTHETIC ENHANCEMENTS ---
* 3D Balloon Shading: Add subtle radial gradients to balloons for a glossy, realistic latex look.
* Dynamic Time of Day: Shift sky colors based on local time (Sunrise, Noon, Sunset, Night).
* Parallax Clouds: Multiple layers of clouds moving at different speeds to create depth.
* Shape Variety: Different balloon shapes (Hearts, Stars) for different task categories.

--- INTERACTIVE POLISH ---
* Sound Effects: Gentle whooshes for movement, soft thumps for collisions, and satisfying pops for completion.
* Drag & Toss: Allow manual dragging and energetic tossing of balloons against the walls.
* Wind Physics: Make threads react dynamically to balloon velocity and air resistance.

--- UTILITY & PRODUCTIVITY ---
* Persistence: Implement localStorage to save balloons between browser sessions.
* Priority via Size: Scale balloon size based on task importance.pus
* Urgency "Sagging": Balloons lose buoyancy and sink lower as deadlines approach.
* Task Clustering: Ability to tie related balloons together into projects.

--- GAMIFICATION ---
* Pop Counter: A dashboard stat tracking how many balloons have been popped over time.
